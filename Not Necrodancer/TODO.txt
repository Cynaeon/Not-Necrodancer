====TODO====
PRIORITY:
Different songs have different levels
Show top grade in song select (or a records screen idk)
Save the customizations
Hard mode
Bug: sometimes (always actually) score is not being entered into hiscores 
Bug: Star power lasts doesn't last full time
Rescale/rethink scoring system 
More enemy types

Try to model a player character xD
Work on a song xDD

FANCY STUFF:
Level up sphere still sometimes spawns huge
Danger flashing doesn't reset on every beat
Camera moves smoothly to the starting position
Fade-in on the star power effect
Improve enemy spawning
Read up on good coding and naming practices and CLEAN UP YOUR CODE WTF

KINDLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:
Song completion grade
Level gauge
Endless mode (end on first death)
Score system in a randomly generated level???
Background ray color shift based on level

FEATURE CREEP!!!: 
Spherical playarea
Custom music


====DONE====
Fix grading system (2hard to get 5 stars maybe) ITS BROKEN THATS WHY
Remake level up sphere, also fix it spawning in random sizes
Collectables required for level ups scale with song length
Come up with something to have the songs load when they are selected, not all at once at launch
Player to be placed at 0,100,0 so the light trail on respawning is centered
Tweak the light rays to look better when the playarea is small
Play area size not being reset (probably)
Menu background on song end menu
Hide mouse cursor
Slow down cam rotation
Platforms immediately return to normal color after spinning (rather than on the next beat (might get fixed when everything is bound to beat))
Floor bounces randomly at menu idle
Better colors in customization
Platform grid color messes up after song finish
Star power and high tempo carry on to the next song
Bug: Player can exit the stage while invulnerable
Level not resetting
Quit button
Menu ambience louder
UI scale is FUCKED
Pause with restart
Song ending with buttons (retry, menu) and game reset
Song info in the select menu (bpm, hiscore etc)
Do something cool with the directional light
Playarea light matches the background ray color
New font for song info
Platform material switches shader mode to get particles and shadows working
Disco floor color intensity based on beatstreak
Hiscores for each song
Menu system and song select
Shorter songs
Platforms immediately return to normal color after spinning (rather than on the next beat (might get fixed when everything is bound to beat))
Some clearer indicator of streak ending
Make everything bound to beats (enemy movement etc)
Platforms return to idle color immeadiately on missed beat
Base class for enemies
Stop spawning levelups at max level
Pickups flash when about to expire
Some effect on movement (particles by movement)
Song start so that the player can catch the first beat
Hiscore tables
Danger flash on platforms when spinning
Shadow on player (or something of sort)
Platforms don't flash danger if an enemy triggers them right after another (ontriggerstay?)
Song starts with a small delay
Song end color on platforms
Disco floor only on when playing well
Score multiplier on unmissed beats
Sounds effects (levelup, death...)

Fix the fking spinning
Surround play area with death
Reduce score on player death
Reduce play area on level up
Platform don't spin sometimes??
Death on descended platforms
Some visual indicator of the current level
Speed up enemy spawns on level up

====CONSIDERED====
Ascend platforms on leveldown
