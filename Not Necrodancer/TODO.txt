====TODO====
PRIORITY:
Rescale/rethink scoring system 

Menu system and song select
More enemy types
Pause with restart

FANCY STUFF:
Fade-in on the star power effect
Platforms immediately return to normal color after spinning (rather than on the next beat (might get fixed when everything is bound to beat))
Do something cool with the directional light
Improve enemy spawning
Read up on good coding and naming practices and CLEAN UP YOUR CODE WTF

KINDLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:
Level gauge
Endless mode (end on first death)
Score system in a randomly generated level???
Background ray color shift based on level


====DONE====
Shorter songs
Platforms immediately return to normal color after spinning (rather than on the next beat (might get fixed when everything is bound to beat))
Some clearer indicator of streak ending
Make everything bound to beats (enemy movement etc)
Platforms return to idle color immeadiately on missed beat
Base class for enemies
Stop spawning levelups at max level
Pickups flash when about to expire
Some effect on movement (particles by movement)
Song start so that the player can catch the first beat
Hiscore tables
Danger flash on platforms when spinning
Shadow on player (or something of sort)
Platforms don't flash danger if an enemy triggers them right after another (ontriggerstay?)
Song starts with a small delay
Song end color on platforms
Disco floor only on when playing well
Score multiplier on unmissed beats
Sounds effects (levelup, death...)

Fix the fking spinning
Surround play area with death
Reduce score on player death
Reduce play area on level up
Platform don't spin sometimes??
Death on descended platforms
Some visual indicator of the current level
Speed up enemy spawns on level up

====CONSIDERED====
Ascend platforms on leveldown
