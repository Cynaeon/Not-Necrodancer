====TODO====
PRIORITY:
Menu system and song select
Improve enemy spawning
Shadow on player (or something of sort)
Song start so that the player can catch the first beat
Stop spawning levelups at max level

FANCY STUFF:
Level gauge
Read up on good coding and naming practices and CLEAN UP YOUR CODE WTF

KINDLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:
Score system in a randomly generated level???
Background ray color shift based on level
Ascend platforms on leveldown




====DONE====
Platforms don't flash danger if an enemy triggers them right after another (ontriggerstay?)
Song starts with a small delay
Song end color on platforms
Disco floor only on when playing well
Score multiplier on unmissed beats
Sounds effects (levelup, death...)

Fix the fking spinning
Surround play area with death
Reduce score on player death
Reduce play area on level up
Platform don't spin sometimes??
Death on descended platforms
Some visual indicator of the current level
Speed up enemy spawns on level up
