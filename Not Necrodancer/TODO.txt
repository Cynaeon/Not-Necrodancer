====TODO====
PRIORITY:
Sounds effects (levelup, death...)
Platforms don't flash danger if an enemy triggers them right after another
Improve enemy spawning
Speed up enemy spawns on level up
New song pls
Shadow on player (or something of sort)
Song ending

FANCY STUFF:
Disco floor only on when playing well
Song starts with a small delay
Level gauge

KINDLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:
Ascend platforms on leveldown




====DONE====
Fix the fking spinning
Surround play area with death
Reduce score on player death
Reduce play area on level up
Platform don't spin sometimes??
Death on descended platforms
Some visual indicator of the current level
